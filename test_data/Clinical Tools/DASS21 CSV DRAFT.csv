382,"",Instruction,,,,,,,false,false,false,"","<p>The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) is the short form of the DASS-42, a self-report scale designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress in adults. The three scales of the DASS have been shown to have high internal consistency and yield meaningful discriminations, and therefore should meet the needs of both researchers and clinicians who wish to measure current state or change in state over time (e.g., during treatment).</p>
<p>This scale is suitable for clinical and non-clinical settings. Please read each statement and choose a number 0, 1, 2 or 3 that indicates how much the statement applied to you over the past week. There are no right or wrong answers. Do not spend too much time on any statement.</p>
